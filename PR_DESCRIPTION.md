# Password Security Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Added Password Field to User Model**:
   - Updated Prisma schema to include a `password` field for secure credentials storage
   - Created migration for the database schema update

2. **Registration Endpoint Security**:
   - Implemented bcrypt password hashing before storing user credentials
   - Used recommended 10 salt rounds for secure hashing
   - User passwords are now securely stored in the database

3. **Login Authentication Security**:
   - Updated NextAuth configuration to properly verify password matches
   - Implemented bcrypt for password comparison during login
   - Only allows login if provided password matches the stored hash

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Added bcrypt for password hashing and verification
   - Added type definitions for bcrypt for TypeScript integration

## Technical Details

- Password hashing implemented with industry-standard bcrypt algorithm
- All passwords go through secure one-way hashing before storage
- Password verification uses constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- User registration process now follows security best practices

## Testing Instructions

1. Register a new user account at `/auth/register`
2. Confirm login works with the correct password at `/auth/login`
3. Verify login fails with incorrect password
4. Check database to confirm passwords are stored as hashes, not plaintext

## Next Steps

- Add password reset functionality
- Consider implementing progressive key derivation for further security
- Add password strength requirements
