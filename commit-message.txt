fix: persist gallery image removal to database

This commit resolves the issue where removed gallery images would reappear after saving the gallery.

The key changes include:
- Updated confirmRemoveImage in gallery edit page to call GalleryService.removeImage
- Fixed tests in enhanced-gallery-hook.test.ts to properly mock GalleryService
- Added deprecation notice to DELETE endpoint for gallery images
- Created documentation in docs/gallery-image-removal-fix.md

The implementation now follows a consistent pattern of managing gallery images through the gallery update endpoint, ensuring that image removals are properly persisted.
