# CreateGallery Component Testing Plan

## Current State
The tests for the `CreateGallery` component are now working properly. We've successfully cleaned up all transitional files and removed the "WithZod" suffix throughout the codebase.

## Resolved Issues
We've successfully addressed the circular dependencies and naming conflicts that were causing problems:

1. The `/src/components/CreateGallery/index.ts` file now exports:
   - `CreateGallery` (modern implementation with Zod validation)
   - `CreateGalleryBridge` (bridge component for backward compatibility)

2. We've eliminated circular references by:
   - Removing the "WithZod" suffix from all component exports
   - Removing the legacy implementation that's no longer needed
   - Using direct exports without aliases

## Completed Improvements

### Standardized Component Exports
- Updated the `/src/components/CreateGallery/index.ts` file to avoid circular references and name conflicts
- Renamed the physical files to match the standardized names
- Removed transition files with "WithZod" suffix

### Test Improvements
- Created a dedicated mock component for testing that provides predictable test behavior
- Updated tests to use the renamed components
- Removed empty mock files

### Step 3: Update Test References
- Update all test files to use the correct component references
- Replace `<CreateGallery />` with `<CreateGalleryWithZod />` where needed
- Add proper mocks for dependencies like `useEnhancedGalleryImages`

### Step 4: Re-enable Tests
- Remove the `.skip` from all skipped tests
- Run tests incrementally, fixing any remaining issues

## Future Improvements
1. Rename the actual component files to match their exported names:
   - `/src/components/CreateGallery/CreateGalleryWithZod.tsx` â†’ `/src/components/CreateGallery/CreateGallery.tsx`
   
2. Update import statements throughout the codebase to use the new standardized names:
   - From: `import { CreateGalleryWithZod } from '@/components/CreateGallery'` 
   - To: `import { CreateGallery } from '@/components/CreateGallery'`

3. Create a consistent component naming convention and document it for future development.
