# E2E Tests Fix - May 2025

## Summary

Fixed E2E test failures in the delete account functionality by adding missing `data-testid` attributes.

## Issue

The account deletion test in `e2e-tests/auth.spec.ts` was failing with a timeout error when attempting to find the delete confirmation input field. The test was looking for an element with `data-testid="delete-confirmation-input"`, but this attribute was missing in the implementation.

## Fix

Added the missing `data-testid` attribute to the input field in the `DeleteAccountDialog` component:

```tsx
<input
  type="text"
  value={confirmText}
  onChange={(e) => setConfirmText(e.target.value)}
  className="w-full px-4 py-2 rounded-md border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-700"
  placeholder="DELETE"
  autoComplete="off"
  data-testid="delete-confirmation-input"
/>
```

## Verification

- Ran the specific failing test: `npx playwright test e2e-tests/auth.spec.ts`
- Ran all E2E tests: `npx playwright test`
- Ran all unit tests: `npm test`

All tests are now passing.

## Notes

The test failures that show up when running `npm test` for E2E tests are expected, as Playwright tests should be run with `npx playwright test` instead of Jest.
