# E2E Test Cleanup System Update - May 2025

## Summary

Enhanced the E2E test cleanup system to provide more comprehensive cleanup options, including the ability to delete the test user account. This update improves test isolation and makes it easier to clean up after problematic test runs.

## Improvements

1. **Enhanced API Endpoint**:
   - Added optional `deleteUser` query parameter to `/api/e2e/cleanup`
   - Implemented user account deletion functionality
   - Added detailed statistics on deleted items

2. **Helper Methods**:
   - Updated `TestHelpers.cleanupTestData()` to accept a `deleteUser` parameter
   - Added `TestHelpers.completeCleanup()` method for full cleanup including user deletion

3. **Global Teardown**:
   - Implemented authentication in global teardown
   - Added optional user deletion via `E2E_DELETE_USER_ON_TEARDOWN` environment variable
   - Improved error handling and reporting

4. **UI Improvements**:
   - Enhanced the cleanup button with separate options for data-only and complete cleanup
   - Added confirmation dialogs with clear warnings
   - Improved result reporting and error handling

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated [E2E Test Cleanup](./e2e-test-cleanup.md) documentation
   - Added E2E tests README with usage instructions
   - Created a dedicated test for the user deletion functionality

## Implementation Details

### API Changes

```typescript
// Enhanced endpoint with user deletion option
DELETE /api/e2e/cleanup?deleteUser=true
```

### Helper Methods

```typescript
// Clean up test data only
await TestHelpers.cleanupTestData(page);

// Clean up test data AND delete the user account
await TestHelpers.completeCleanup(page);
```

### Global Teardown

```typescript
// In global-teardown.ts
const shouldDeleteUser = process.env.E2E_DELETE_USER_ON_TEARDOWN === 'true';
const cleanupEndpoint = shouldDeleteUser ? 
  '/api/e2e/cleanup?deleteUser=true' : 
  '/api/e2e/cleanup';
```

### Environment Variables

```
# Optional: Enable user deletion during global teardown
E2E_DELETE_USER_ON_TEARDOWN="true"
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Cleanup Method

1. **Data-only cleanup** (default) - For most tests
   - Preserves the test user account
   - Suitable for regular test runs
   - Fast and non-disruptive

2. **Complete cleanup** (with user deletion) - For problematic test states
   - Deletes the test user account
   - Use when tests have corrupted the user state
   - Requires account recreation for subsequent tests

### Best Practices

1. Use data-only cleanup for regular testing
2. Use complete cleanup only when necessary
3. Be aware that user deletion will affect subsequent tests
4. Ensure global setup is configured to recreate the test user

## Testing

The new functionality has been thoroughly tested:

- Automated test in `user-deletion.spec.ts`
- Manual testing of the cleanup API
- Verification of the enhanced UI buttons
- Integration with global teardown

## Future Improvements

1. Add option to selectively clean up specific galleries or images
2. Implement cleanup checkpoints for long-running test suites
3. Add detailed cleanup logging for better debugging
4. Consider integrating with CI/CD systems for automated cleanup
