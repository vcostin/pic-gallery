# Component Refactoring: Next Steps

This document outlines the remaining tasks for completing the component refactoring and schema migration.

## Completed Tasks

✅ Moved all major form components to feature-based directories:
  - GalleryDetails components
  - EditImage components
  - Profile components
  - TagsManagement components
  - CreateGallery components

✅ Updated tests to use new import paths

✅ Created documentation:
  - Component organization strategy
  - Component directory guide
  - Updated migration tasks

✅ Cleaned up duplicate component files:
  - EditImageDialog (removed obsolete files)
  - ProfileForm (removed obsolete files and backup files)
  - CreateGallery (removed obsolete files)
  - GalleryDetailsForm (removed obsolete files)
  - TagsManagement (verified no obsolete files)

## Upcoming Tasks

### 1. Additional Tests

- [ ] Add tests for special cases in each component:
  - [x] GalleryDetailsFormWithZod special validation cases
  - [x] EditImageDialogWithZod error handling
  - [x] ProfileFormWithZod validation scenarios
  - [x] TagsManagementWithZod edge cases
  - [x] CreateGalleryWithZod form submission

### 2. Component Template

- [x] Create a standardized component template that follows best practices
- [x] Include sample code for:
  - [x] Schema-based validation
  - [x] Form handling
  - [x] Error reporting
  - [x] TypeScript type derivation

### 3. Consumer Updates

- [x] Update `/app/galleries/[id]/edit/page.tsx` to use GalleryDetailsFormWithZod directly
- [x] Test all form components with various inputs
- [x] Verify error handling and validation messages
- [ ] Update test mocks to match the current implementations

### 4. Component Renaming

In a future update, consider removing the "WithZod" suffix from components:

- [ ] Create a plan for renaming components
- [ ] Update all imports
- [ ] Update documentation

### 5. Final Documentation Updates

- [ ] Add section on form validation to onboarding docs
- [ ] Update main README.md with component organization overview
- [ ] Document schema-based type pattern for new developers
- [ ] Create a test troubleshooting guide

## Guidelines for Adding New Components

When adding new components:

1. Always place them in the appropriate feature directory
2. Create or update the index.ts file with proper exports
3. Use schema-based validation with Zod
4. Write tests that import from the feature directory
5. Document the component's usage and API

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (Completed): Directory structure and component movement
- Phase 2 (Completed): Test updates and documentation
- Phase 3 (Current): Consumer updates and additional tests
- Phase 4 (Future): Component renaming and final cleanup
