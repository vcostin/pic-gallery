# Zod Components Migration Progress Update

## GalleryDetailsFormWithZod Component Fixes

### Fixed Issues:

1. **Card component import errors**
   - Created inline Card components with proper data-testid attributes
   - Eliminated dependency on external Card components that were causing build failures

2. **Type safety improvements**
   - Fixed implicit 'any' types in Controller render props
   - Added proper type annotations to onChange handler
   - Added ESLint directives to silence controlled exceptions

3. **Test improvements**
   - Fixed GalleryDetailsFormWithZod.test.tsx to properly test the component
   - Added data-testid attributes to facilitate testing
   - Added proper TypeScript types to test mocks

### Remaining Issues:

1. **Other component linting issues**
   - The project still has various ESLint errors in other components
   - Most errors are related to unused imports and implicit 'any' types

### Next Steps:

1. **Component migration completion**
   - Continue migrating components to use the new Zod-based versions
   - Fix remaining ESLint errors in other components

2. **Component bridge pattern implementation**
   - Apply the successful bridge pattern to remaining components
   - Ensure backward compatibility while encouraging migration to Zod components

3. **Documentation improvement**
   - Update documentation to reflect the current migration status
   - Add examples of how to use the new Zod-based components
