# GalleryDetailsForm Migration Status

## Current Status

The GalleryDetailsForm component has been migrated to use Zod for form validation and has been successfully relocated to a feature-based directory structure.

### Current Files

- ✅ Tests have been updated to use the Zod version:
  - `/src/components/__tests__/GalleryDetailsFormWithZod.test.tsx`

- ✅ Legacy files have been removed from the root components directory:
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetailsForm.tsx`
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetailsFormBridge.tsx`
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetailsFormWithZod.tsx`
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetailsFormWithZod.tsx.bak`
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetailsFormBridge.tsx.new`

- ✅ Component files created in the feature-based directory:
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetails/GalleryDetailsFormWithZod.tsx`
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetails/GalleryDetailsFormBridge.tsx`
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetails/ModernGalleryDetailsForm.tsx`
  - `/src/components/GalleryDetails/index.ts`

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Implemented Zod validation
- ✅ Created and updated tests for the Zod version
- ✅ Removed duplicate files from the root components directory
- ✅ Created this documentation
- ✅ Created a feature-based directory structure for this component
- ✅ Created an index.ts file to export the Zod version

## Remaining Tasks

- [x] Component renamed to remove the "WithZod" suffix by updating exports
- [ ] Address any remaining test issues (React act() warnings)
- [ ] Update imports across the codebase to use the modern name

## Usage Notes

The component can be imported from its feature-based directory:

```tsx
// Import the modern version (recommended)
import { GalleryDetailsForm } from '@/components/GalleryDetails';

// Or use the default export 
import GalleryDetailsForm from '@/components/GalleryDetails';

// Legacy option (for backward compatibility)
import { GalleryDetailsFormWithZod } from '@/components/GalleryDetails';

// Then in your component:
<GalleryDetailsForm 
  gallery={gallery}
  onSubmit={handleSubmit} 
/>
```
