# Playwright Configuration Consolidation

## Summary
Reduced from 4 Playwright configurations to 2 focused configurations, eliminating redundancy and confusion.

## Before (4 configs):
- ❌ `playwright.config.ts` - Main config (basic)
- ✅ `playwright.config.optimized.ts` - Enhanced config (actively used)
- ✅ `playwright.config.dev.ts` - Ultra-fast development config
- ❌ `playwright.config.parallel-future.ts` - Experimental (marked "DO NOT USE")

## After (2 configs):
- ✅ `playwright.config.ts` - Main config (promoted from optimized)
- ✅ `playwright.config.dev.ts` - Ultra-fast development config

## Changes Made

### 1. Promoted Optimized Config
- **Action:** Renamed `playwright.config.optimized.ts` → `playwright.config.ts`
- **Reason:** The optimized config was already used by all specialized npm scripts
- **Benefits:** Enhanced performance detection, better logging, optimized browser args

### 2. Removed Redundant Configs
- **Removed:** Old `playwright.config.ts` (basic version)
- **Removed:** `playwright.config.parallel-future.ts` (experimental)
- **Reason:** Superseded by optimized version / not ready for use

### 3. Updated Package.json Scripts
- **Changed:** Removed explicit `--config=playwright.config.optimized.ts` references
- **Added:** New `test:e2e:dev-ultra` script for ultra-fast development
- **Result:** All scripts now use the main config by default

## Usage

### Main Configuration (Default)
```bash
npm run test:e2e              # Standard E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:fast         # Fast mode
npm run test:e2e:fail-fast    # Fail fast mode
npm run test:e2e:optimized    # Optimized mode
npm run test:e2e:perf         # Performance logging
```

### Development Configuration (Ultra-Fast)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:dev-ultra    # Ultra-fast development (1s timeouts)
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity:** 50% fewer config files
2. **Eliminated Confusion:** No more wondering which config to use
3. **Better Defaults:** Main config now uses the enhanced optimized version
4. **Maintained Flexibility:** Still have fast development option
5. **Cleaner Package.json:** Removed redundant config specifications

## Configuration Features

### Main Config (`playwright.config.ts`)
- Environment detection (CI, fast mode, optimized mode)
- Enhanced performance logging
- Worker optimization based on environment
- Sequential execution for stability
- Comprehensive project configurations
- Advanced browser launch optimizations

### Dev Config (`playwright.config.dev.ts`)
- Ultra-aggressive timeouts (1s assertions, 10s tests)
- Maximum parallelization
- No retries (immediate feedback)
- Minimal reporting for speed
- Perfect for rapid development iteration
