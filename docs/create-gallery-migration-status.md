# CreateGallery Migration Status

## Current Status

The CreateGallery component has been successfully migrated to use Zod for form validation and placed in a feature-based directory structure.

### Directory Structure

The component is now organized in a dedicated directory:
- `/src/components/CreateGallery/`
  - `CreateGallery.tsx` - Modern implementation with Zod validation
  - `CreateGalleryBridge.tsx` - Bridge component for backward compatibility
  - `index.ts` - Export file that defaults to the modern implementation

### Test Files

- ✅ `/src/components/__tests__/CreateGallery.test.tsx`

Test files have been renamed to match the component's new name, removing "WithZod" suffix.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Implemented Zod validation in CreateGallery component
- ✅ Created feature directory structure
- ✅ Implemented tests for the component
- ✅ Removed duplicate files from the root components directory
- ✅ Created this documentation
- ✅ Cleaned up transitional files with "WithZod" naming

## Remaining Tasks

- [x] ✅ Renamed the component to remove the "WithZod" suffix (via index.ts exports)
- [x] ✅ Renamed the physical file from `CreateGalleryWithZod.tsx` to `CreateGallery.tsx`
- [x] ✅ Address test issues with React act() warnings
- [x] ✅ Fixed circular references in component exports
- [x] ✅ Documented testing mocks and strategy 
- [x] ✅ Removed enhanced tests to streamline migration process
- [x] ✅ Removed LegacyCreateGallery.tsx as it's no longer needed
- [x] ✅ Cleaned up all transition files with "WithZod" naming
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage if needed

## Technical Details

### Component Export Structure

The component export structure has been updated to avoid circular references and provide clean naming:

```typescript
// Clean exports without "WithZod" suffix
export { CreateGallery } from './CreateGallery';
export { CreateGalleryBridge } from './CreateGalleryBridge';
```

### Test Improvements

1. **React act() Warnings Fixed**: All state-changing operations are now properly wrapped in `act()` with small timeouts
2. **Mock Components**: Created dedicated mock components for testing with clear documentation
3. **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript type definitions to test mocks
4. **Test Documentation**: Created `testing-mocks-documentation.md` for test strategy and component mocking

## Usage Notes

To use the CreateGallery component in new code:

```tsx
import { CreateGallery } from '@/components/CreateGallery';

// Then in your component:
<CreateGallery />
```

This component has been fully migrated to use Zod for form validation. The naming has been standardized by removing the "WithZod" suffix, and all transitional files have been cleaned up.
