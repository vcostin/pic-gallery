## TagsManagement Migration Status and Plan

### Current Status (May 17, 2025)

The TagsManagement component was found to be in an unusual state:

- `TagsManagementWithZod.tsx` exists in the codebase, but `TagsManagement.tsx` appears to be missing
- The migration documentation refers to both components
- Only the Zod version appears to be in active use in the codebase

### Recommendations

1. **Verify usage**: We should verify whether any part of the codebase depends on a legacy `TagsManagement.tsx` component.

2. **Documentation update**: If no legacy component exists:
   - Update the migration documentation to reflect that `TagsManagementWithZod` was implemented directly
   - Remove references to `TagsManagement.tsx` from migration plans

3. **Future-proofing**: Even without a legacy component, we should:
   - Keep the consistent naming convention (`WithZod` suffix)
   - Consider renaming in a future breaking change release

4. **No bridge needed**: Since there's no legacy component, we don't need to create a bridge component.

### Completed Work

- ✅ Verified `TagsManagementWithZod.tsx` exists and is functional
- ✅ Confirmed no `TagsManagement.tsx` exists in the codebase
- ✅ Updated migration documentation to reflect current status
- ✅ Renamed component to remove "WithZod" suffix (via index.ts exports)

### Next Steps

- [x] Review components that use `TagsManagementWithZod`
- [x] Ensure tests cover all functionality
  - ✅ `/src/components/__tests__/TagsManagementWithZod.test.tsx`
  - ✅ `/src/components/__tests__/TagsManagementWithZod.enhanced.test.tsx`
- [x] Component renamed to remove `WithZod` suffix (via index.ts exports)
- [ ] Consider renaming the actual file from TagsManagementWithZod.tsx to TagsManagement.tsx in a future update
- [ ] Update import statements throughout the codebase to use the new standard name
