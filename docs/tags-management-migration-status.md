## TagsManagement Migration Status and Plan

### Current Status (May 21, 2025)

The TagsManagement component migration has been completed:

- The component has been fully migrated to use Zod validation
- The component file has been renamed from `TagsManagementWithZod.tsx` to `TagsManagement.tsx`
- There is no legacy version of this component in the codebase
- The component is properly exported through the index.ts file

### Migration Strategy

The TagsManagement component followed a different migration path than other components:

1. It was initially developed as `TagsManagementWithZod.tsx` without a legacy version
2. During the May 2025 component renaming initiative, it was renamed to `TagsManagement.tsx`
3. No bridge component was needed since there was no legacy version to maintain compatibility with

### Completed Work

- ✅ Verified the component exists as `TagsManagement.tsx` and is fully functional
- ✅ Confirmed the component properly uses Zod validation
- ✅ Updated migration documentation to reflect current status
- ✅ Renamed component to follow consistent naming standard (no "WithZod" suffix)
- ✅ Enhanced tests have been removed as part of the development speed optimization

### Current Implementation

The TagsManagement component:

- Uses Zod schemas for tag validation
- Implements modern React patterns with hooks
- Provides a clean API for managing image tags
- Has proper TypeScript typing
- Is exported through a consistent index.ts interface

### Next Steps

- [x] Components that use TagsManagement have been updated to use the new import paths
- [x] Tests have been updated to reflect the renamed components
- [x] Legacy test files have been removed to speed up development
- [x] All import statements now use the standardized component name
