## Integration with Other Test Suites

The enhanced upload functionality is also tested within:

1. **`comprehensive-gallery-workflow.spec.ts`**
   - Enhanced upload integration in complete workflows
   - Cross-feature interactions

2. **`gallery-management.spec.ts`**
   - Enhanced upload with gallery associations
   - Gallery workflow integration

3. **`authenticated.spec.ts`**
   - Enhanced upload interface validation
   - Authentication context testing

## Test Configuration

- **Test File**: `/e2e-tests/enhanced-upload.spec.ts`
- **Configuration**: Added to `data-dependent` project in `playwright.config.ts`
- **Execution Strategy**: Serial execution to avoid race conditions
- **Test Data**: Uses standardized test images from `/test-data/images/`
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after each test run

## Key Technical Improvements

1. **Selector Robustness**: Uses `data-testid` attributes for reliable element selection
2. **Tag Input Testing**: Proper handling of custom TagInput component interactions
3. **Error Scenario Coverage**: Comprehensive validation and error state testing
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Tests ensure UI state transitions work correctly
5. **Cleanup Verification**: Tests verify proper cleanup and state reset

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements

1. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for large file upload performance
