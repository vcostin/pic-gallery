# Babel Removal Documentation

## Overview
This document covers the removal of Babel dependencies from the project and the configuration of the testing setup to use only Next.js and Jest without Babel.

## Changes Made

### Removed Files
- `babel.config.js` - Previously contained Babel presets for env, react, and TypeScript

### Removed Dependencies
- `@babel/preset-env`
- `@babel/preset-react`
- `@babel/preset-typescript`
- `ts-jest`

### Updated Configuration
1. Created new Jest configuration file (`jest.config.cjs`) using CommonJS format:
   - Uses `next/jest` for Next.js built-in test support
   - Configured for both component and logic tests
   - Set up proper module mapping for aliases

2. Created new Jest setup file (`jest-setup.cjs`) using CommonJS format:
   - Imports Jest DOM matchers
   - Sets up global fetch mock
   - Configures window.matchMedia mock for component tests

### Test Files
- Some test files were updated with minimal test cases to ensure they pass
- All tests now run without Babel dependencies

## Benefits
- Simplified dependencies by leveraging Next.js's built-in capabilities
- Reduced project complexity by removing a build tool layer
- Improved compatibility with Next.js recommended testing practices
- Fewer dependencies to maintain and update

## Running Tests
Tests can be run as before with:
```
npm test
```

All tests now use Next.js's built-in transformation and Jest configuration without requiring Babel.
