# Zod Components Migration: Next Steps and Recommendations

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Testing Phase
- Create comprehensive test cases for each migrated component
- Focus on edge cases, especially around validation
- Ensure backward compatibility is maintained
- Verify accessibility is not compromised

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Update component API documentation to reference Zod versions
- Add examples of direct Zod component usage
- Create migration guides for each component
- Add Storybook examples showing validation behavior

### 3. Consumer Migration
- Identify all components using legacy implementations
- Create prioritized list for migration
- Update high-priority consumers first
- Track migration progress in a shared document

## Long-term Recommendations

### 1. Component Cleanup (July 2025)
- Remove legacy components after all consumers are migrated
- Remove bridge components once no longer needed
- Update imports throughout the codebase
- Remove deprecated exports

### 2. Naming Convention Updates (May-August 2025)
- ✅ Removed `WithZod` suffix from component names (May 2025)
- ✅ Created new exports with standard names for all components: GalleryDetailsForm, ProfileForm, EditImageDialog, TagsManagement, and CreateGallery
- ✅ Maintaining backward compatibility with aliases
- ⏳ Gradually update all component imports to use the standard names
- ⏳ Consider renaming the actual files (e.g., from `ProfileFormWithZod.tsx` to `ProfileForm.tsx`) in a future update
- ✅ Document the new standard naming convention

### 3. Form Creation Pattern (September 2025)
- Create a standardized factory/HOC for form components
- Extract common patterns into reusable hooks
- Create a form component template generator
- Document best practices for new form components

## Technical Debt Considerations

### Addressing Type Issues
Several of the bridge components currently use `@ts-expect-error` comments to handle type incompatibilities. We should:

- Review each instance and create proper type definitions
- Extract common patterns into shared types
- Create better type compatibility between versions
- Remove all `@ts-expect-error` comments

### React Hook Form Integration
The current implementation sometimes has issues with React Hook Form typings. We should:

- Create proper type definitions for form controls
- Extract common form-related types to a shared location
- Improve the developer experience with better type inference
- Consider custom hooks for common form patterns

## Future-proofing

### Next.js App Router Compatibility
Ensure all form components work well with:

- Server Components (when used appropriately)
- Client Components
- Data loading patterns in App Router

### Component Library Consistency
- Align with design system patterns
- Ensure consistent prop naming across components
- Document component composition patterns
- Create a component testing strategy

## Measuring Success

- Track number of components migrated
- Monitor TypeScript errors in the codebase
- Collect developer feedback on new components
- Measure reduction in form-related bugs
