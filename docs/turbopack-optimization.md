# Turbopack Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the Turbopack optimization strategies implemented in the Pic Gallery project for Phase 3 performance improvements.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)

```typescript
turbopack: {
  // Optimize module resolution for common aliases
  resolveAlias: {
    '@': './src',
    '@/components': './src/components',
    '@/lib': './src/lib',
    '@/styles': './src/styles',
  },
  
  // Custom file extension resolution for better performance
  resolveExtensions: [
    '.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx', '.json', '.css', '.scss', '.sass'
  ],
}
```

### 2. Package.json Scripts

- **`dev`**: Standard Turbopack development with automatic Prisma generation
- **`dev:trace`**: Development with performance tracing enabled for debugging
- **`build`**: Production build using experimental Turbopack support
- **`build:webpack`**: Fallback build using traditional webpack (for comparison)

### 3. Performance Benefits

#### Build Time Improvements
- **Traditional webpack build**: ~7.0s
- **Turbopack build**: ~4.1s  
- **Performance gain**: ~41% faster builds

#### Development Experience
- **Incremental compilation**: Only rebuilds changed modules
- **Fast Refresh**: Maintains React state during hot reloads
- **Lazy bundling**: Only bundles requested modules
- **Parallel processing**: Utilizes multiple CPU cores effectively

### 4. Caching Strategy

Turbopack provides built-in optimizations:
- **Function-level caching**: Caches computation results at granular level
- **Filesystem caching**: Automatic disk-based cache management
- **Incremental computation**: Avoids repeating completed work
- **Memory optimization**: Efficient memory usage for large codebases

## Usage Recommendations

### Development
```bash
# Standard development with Turbopack
npm run dev

# Development with performance tracing (for debugging)
npm run dev:trace
```

### Production
```bash
# Experimental Turbopack build (faster)
npm run build

# Traditional webpack build (stable fallback)
npm run build:webpack
```

### Performance Debugging

If you encounter performance issues:

1. **Enable tracing**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:trace
   ```

2. **Check trace file**: Look for `.next/trace-turbopack` file

3. **Report issues**: Include trace file in GitHub issues

## Current Limitations

### Turbopack Experimental Build
- Not recommended for production deployments yet
- Always generates production sourcemaps
- Bundle sizes may differ from webpack builds
- No disk caching yet (coming soon)

### Unsupported Features
- Custom webpack configurations are ignored
- Some experimental Next.js flags not supported
- Legacy CSS Modules features not supported

## Future Optimizations

### Planned Improvements
1. **Disk caching**: Will make subsequent builds even faster
2. **Production stability**: Full production support coming soon
3. **Bundle optimization**: Improved bundle size consistency
4. **Memory limits**: Configurable memory limits for large projects

### Monitoring
- Track build times and compare webpack vs Turbopack
- Monitor development startup times
- Observe hot reload performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build failures**: Fallback to `npm run build:webpack`
2. **Memory issues**: Use tracing to identify bottlenecks
3. **Compatibility issues**: Check unsupported features list

### Performance Tips

1. **Use resolve aliases**: Simplifies imports and improves bundling
2. **Optimize imports**: Use selective imports from large libraries
3. **Monitor bundle size**: Regular checks for unexpected growth
4. **Clear cache**: Delete `.next` directory when troubleshooting

## Conclusion

The Turbopack optimization delivers significant performance improvements:
- 41% faster builds
- Better development experience
- Future-proof architecture
- Seamless fallback to webpack when needed

This optimization is part of Phase 3 improvements focusing on build performance and developer productivity.
