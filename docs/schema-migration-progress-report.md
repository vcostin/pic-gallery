# Schema and Type Migration Progress Report

## Completed Work

1. **Component Templates**
   - Created `SchemaBasedComponent.tsx` as a template for developers to follow
   - Created `schema-api-template.ts` to demonstrate schema validation in API routes

2. **Component Refactoring**
   - Updated `GalleryView.tsx` to use schema-derived types
   - Updated `GalleryGrid.tsx` to use schema-derived types
   - Updated `SelectImagesDialog.tsx` to use schema-validated API calls

3. **Type Utility Expansion**
   - Created `imageSelectionMappers.ts` with types and utilities for image selection components
   - Added schema definitions for UI-specific data structures

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `hooks-refactoring-todo.md` to reflect completed work
   - Updated `schema-migration-strategy.md` with current progress

## Key Improvements

1. **Type Safety**:
   - Components now use types derived from Zod schemas
   - Stronger validation at runtime through schema checks

2. **API Integration**:
   - `SelectImagesDialog` now uses schema validation with AbortController for request management
   - Components properly handle typed API responses

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Added template files to help developers create schema-based components
   - Better documentation and tracking of migration progress

## Next Steps

1. **Further Component Migration**:
   - ✅ Created `CreateGalleryWithZod.tsx` using schema-validated forms (parallel implementation)
   - ✅ Created `UploadImageWithService.tsx` using service layer (parallel implementation)
   - Gradually replace or refactor existing components to use the new patterns
   - Migrate remaining image-related components

2. **Service Layer**:
   - ✅ Implemented `imageService.ts` with schema validation
   - ✅ Implemented `userService.ts` with schema validation
   - ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests for services
   - Ensure consistent use of services across components

3. **Form Validation**:
   - ✅ Created `GalleryDetailsFormWithZod.tsx` with react-hook-form and Zod integration
   - Add form schemas for all data entry points
   - Integrate schema validation with form submissions

## Conclusion

The migration to schema-derived types is progressing well. The completion of key components like `GalleryView`, `GalleryGrid`, and `SelectImagesDialog` demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of this approach. The creation of template files will accelerate future migrations by providing clear examples for developers to follow.
