# Schema and Type Migration Progress Report

## Completed Work

1. **Component Templates**
   - Created `SchemaBasedComponent.tsx` as a template for developers to follow
   - Created `schema-api-template.ts` to demonstrate schema validation in API routes

2. **Component Refactoring**
   - Updated `GalleryView.tsx` to use schema-derived types
   - Updated `GalleryGrid.tsx` to use schema-derived types
   - Updated `SelectImagesDialog.tsx` to use schema-validated API calls

3. **Type Utility Expansion**
   - Created `imageSelectionMappers.ts` with types and utilities for image selection components
   - Added schema definitions for UI-specific data structures

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `hooks-refactoring-todo.md` to reflect completed work
   - Updated `schema-migration-strategy.md` with current progress

## Key Improvements

1. **Type Safety**:
   - Components now use types derived from Zod schemas
   - Stronger validation at runtime through schema checks

2. **API Integration**:
   - `SelectImagesDialog` now uses schema validation with AbortController for request management
   - Components properly handle typed API responses

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Added template files to help developers create schema-based components
   - Better documentation and tracking of migration progress

## Next Steps

1. **Further Component Migration**:
   - ✅ Created `CreateGalleryWithZod.tsx` using schema-validated forms (parallel implementation)
   - ✅ Created `UploadImageWithService.tsx` using service layer (parallel implementation)
   - ✅ Created `EditImageDialogWithZod.tsx` using ImageService and react-hook-form
   - ✅ Created `ProfileFormWithZod.tsx` using UserService and Zod validation
   - ✅ Added reusable `TagsInput` component with schema validation
   - ✅ Replaced `EditImageDialog` with `EditImageDialogWithZod` in ImageGrid
   - ✅ Replaced `UploadImage` with `UploadImageWithService` in upload page
   - ✅ Refactored `ImagesPage` to use ImageService for data fetching
   - ✅ Integrated `ProfileFormWithZod` into profile page
   - ✅ Created `TagsManagementWithZod` component with schema validation
   - ✅ Migrated key image-related components
   - Continue replacing remaining components

2. **Service Layer**:
   - ✅ Implemented `imageService.ts` with schema validation
   - ✅ Implemented `userService.ts` with schema validation
   - ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests for services
   - ✅ Integrated services with form components
   - ✅ Established consistent use of services for key components

3. **Form Validation**:
   - ✅ Created `GalleryDetailsFormWithZod.tsx` with react-hook-form and Zod integration
   - ✅ Added form schemas for image editing and user profiles
   - ✅ Integrated schema validation with form submissions

## Conclusion

The migration to schema-derived types has made significant progress. We've successfully replaced several key components with schema-validated versions, including `EditImageDialogWithZod`, `ProfileFormWithZod`, and `UploadImageWithService`. The images-related functionality now consistently leverages the `ImageService` for API interactions, ensuring proper type safety and validation.

The implementation of service layers for both images and users has provided a clean, centralized approach to API interaction with built-in schema validation. These services are now being consistently used across the application, reducing duplicate code and providing a more maintainable architecture.

Form components have been successfully migrated to use react-hook-form with zod validation, ensuring consistent error handling and user feedback. The next phase will involve completing the migration for the remaining components and ensuring all API interactions go through the service layer.
