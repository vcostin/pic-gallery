# Consolidated Refactoring Strategy

This document provides a unified overview of our refactoring strategy for the Picture Gallery application, consolidating information from multiple strategy documents.

## Table of Contents
1. [Goals](#goals)
2. [Component Organization](#component-organization)
3. [Schema Migration](#schema-migration)
4. [Implementation Approach](#implementation-approach)
5. [Timeline & Phases](#timeline-and-phases)

## Goals

Our refactoring efforts aim to achieve:

1. **Improved Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration with schema validation
2. **Consistent Validation** - Same validation logic across frontend and backend
3. **Better Developer Experience** - Auto-completion, type checking, and standardized patterns
4. **Reduced Code Duplication** - Single source of truth for data models and validation
5. **Maintainable Architecture** - Feature-based organization of components

## Component Organization

### Directory Structure

Components are organized into feature-based directories with consistent exports:

```
src/components/
  ├── FeatureName/              # Feature-specific directory
  │   ├── index.ts              # Exports all components in the directory
  │   ├── ComponentName.tsx     # Main component
  │   └── ComponentNameWithZod.tsx  # Zod-validated version
  ├── ui/                       # Shared UI components
  │   ├── Button.tsx
  │   ├── Card.tsx
  │   └── ...
  └── ...
```

### Export Pattern

Each feature directory has an `index.ts` file that provides a clean API:

```typescript
// Main entry point for FeatureName components
import { ComponentNameWithZod } from './ComponentNameWithZod';

// Export the Zod version as the default export (current recommended)
export { ComponentNameWithZod as default };

// Export the Zod version explicitly named
export { ComponentNameWithZod };

// Export types
export type { ComponentNameWithZodProps } from './ComponentNameWithZod';
```

## Schema Migration

### Schema-First Approach

We're adopting a schema-first approach where data models are defined using Zod schemas:

1. Define Zod schemas for all data models
2. Derive TypeScript types from Zod schemas
3. Use schemas for validation in both frontend and API endpoints

### Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth** - Schemas define both types and validation rules
- **Runtime Validation** - Zod provides runtime validation with detailed error messages
- **Automatic Type Derivation** - TypeScript types automatically derived from schemas
- **Integration with React Hook Form** - Schemas work seamlessly with React Hook Form

## Implementation Approach

### Component Migration Process

For each component to be migrated:

1. Create `ComponentNameWithZod.tsx` with Zod schema validation
2. Update tests to verify validation behavior
3. Create feature directory and move component files
4. Update exports to provide migration path
5. Update consuming components to use Zod version
6. Remove legacy component once all references are updated

### Testing Strategy

- Each component must have both unit and enhanced tests
- Unit tests verify core functionality
- Enhanced tests verify integration with forms, validation, and user interactions
- Tests must pass before migration is considered complete

## Timeline and Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Completed)

- Analysis of components and dependencies
- Creation of test coverage for Zod-based components
- Documentation of migration strategy

### Phase 2: Component Consolidation (Current)

- Migration of form components to Zod validators
- Directory restructuring
- Clean up of duplicate files

### Phase 3: API Integration (Future)

- Integration of schemas with backend validation
- End-to-end type safety
- Finalization of component names (removing WithZod suffix)

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Future)

- Removal of legacy code paths
- Documentation consolidation
- Performance optimization
